# NCPI-Whistler-Tutorial
This tutorial is intended to provide a step-by-step for creating a project to transform research data into FHIR resources and (optionally) load those resources into a FHIR server. 

The data that we'll be using is a slightly modified version of some mock data used as an example 
for the [CMG](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/NHGRI-Genome-Sequencing-Program/Centers-for-Mendelian-Genomics-CMG) model to be used to submit data to [the AnVIL Project](https://anvilproject.org/). 

With that said, let's get started!
